A push consumer is where the server is in control and sends messages to the client. It can be made durable or ephemeral based on your use case.

Push consumers are very similiar to the already known `@NatsListener`. Let's look at a quick example.

snippet::io.micronaut.nats.docs.jetstream.ProductListener[tags="imports,clazz",project-base="docs-examples/example"]

<1> The class needs to be annotated with ann:configuration.nats.jetstream.annotation.JetstreamListener[].
<2> The ann:configuration.nats.jetstream.annotation.PushConsumer[] configures the stream(`value`) and the `subject` to listen for. It is possible to use all known values from link:{apinats}{natsVersion}/io/nats/client/SubscribeOptions.html[SubscribeOptions] and link:{apinats}{natsVersion}/io/nats/client/PushSubscribeOptions.html[PushSubscribeOptions] such as `durable`.
