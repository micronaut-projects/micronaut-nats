WARNING: Experimental Preview

The Object Store allows you to store data of any (i.e. large) size by implementing a chunking mechanism, allowing you to for example store and retrieve files (i.e. the object) of any size by associating them with a path and a file name (i.e. the key). You obtain a ObjectStoreManager object from your JetStream context.
