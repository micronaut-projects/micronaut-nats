This library comes with a health indicator for applications that are using the `management` module in Micronaut. See the link:https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] documentation for more information about the endpoint itself.

The information reported from the health indicator is under the `nats` key.

[configuration]
----
"nats": {
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "servers": ["nats://localhost:4222"]
  }
}
----

TIP: To disable the NATS health indicator entirely, add `endpoints.health.nats.enabled: false`.
