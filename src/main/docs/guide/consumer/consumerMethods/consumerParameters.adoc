The link:{apinats}/io/nats/client/Connection.html#createDispatcher-io.nats.client.MessageHandler-[createDispatcher] method is used by the api:configuration.nats.intercept.NatsConsumerAdvice[] to consume messages. Some of the options can be directly configured through annotations.

IMPORTANT: In order for the consumer method to be invoked, all arguments must be satisfied. To allow execution of the method with a null value, the argument *must* be declared as nullable. If the arguments cannot be satisfied, the message will be rejected.
