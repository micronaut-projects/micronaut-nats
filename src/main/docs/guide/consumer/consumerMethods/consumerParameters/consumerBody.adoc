Most examples up to this point have been using a `byte[]` as the body type for simplicity. This library supports most standard Java types and JSON deserialization (using Jackson) by default. The functionality is extensible and it is possible to add support for additional types and deserialization strategies. See the section on <<serdes, Message Serialization/Deserialization>> for more information.
