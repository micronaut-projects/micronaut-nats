All methods that consume messages from NATS must meet the following conditions:

* The method must reside in a class annotated with ann:nats.annotation.NatsListener[].
* The method must be annotated with ann:nats.annotation.Subject[].

NOTE: In order for all of the functionality to work as `designed` in this guide your classes must be compiled with the parameters flag set to `true`.
If your application was created with the Micronaut CLI, then that has already been configured for you.
