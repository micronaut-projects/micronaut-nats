All properties on the link:{apinats}/io/nats/client/Options.html[Options] are available to be modified, either through configuration or a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].

The properties that can be converted from the string values in a configuration file can be configured directly.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.nats.connect.NatsConnectionFactoryConfig.adoc[]

NOTE: Without any configuration the defaults in the link:{apinats}/io/nats/client/Options.html[Options] will be used.

TIP: It is also possible to disable the integration entirely with `nats.enabled: false`


== Connections

It is possible to configure multiple connections to the same server, different servers, or a single connection to one of a list of servers.

[configuration]
----
nats:
  server1:
    addresses:
      - "nats://localhost:4222"
    username: guest
    password: guest
  server2:
    addresses:
      - "nats://randomServer:4222"
    username: guest
    password: guest
----

NATS also supports a fail over connection strategy where the first server that connects successfully will be used among a list of servers. To use this option in Micronaut, simply supply a list of `host:port` addresses.

[configuration]
----
nats:
  default:
    addresses:
      - "nats://localhost:4222"
      - "nats://randomServer:4222"
    username: guest
    password: guest
----

IMPORTANT: When the configuration option `nats.servers` is used, no other options underneath `nats` are read; for example `nats.username`.

If you need to setup TLS, it can be configured this way:

[configuration]
----
nats:
  default:
    addresses:
      - "nats://localhost:4222" # <1>
    tls:
      trust-store-path:  /path/to/client.truststore.jks # <2>
      trust-store-password: secret
      certificate-path: /path/to/certificate.crt # <3>
----

<1> You can either use `nats://localhost:4222` or `tls://localhost:4222` as protocol.
<2> You can configure a complete truststore
<3> Or ou can use a single certificate for connecting to NATS securely.
