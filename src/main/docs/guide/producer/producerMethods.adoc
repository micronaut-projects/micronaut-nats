All methods that publish messages to NATS must meet the following conditions:

* The method must reside in an interface annotated with ann:nats.annotation.NatsClient[].
* The method or a method parameter must be annotated with ann:nats.annotation.Subject[].
* The method must contain an argument representing the body of the message.

IMPORTANT: If a body argument cannot be found, an exception will be thrown.

NOTE: In order for all of the functionality to work as designed in this guide your classes must be compiled with the parameters flag set to `true`. If your application was created with the Micronaut CLI, then that has already been configured for you.

IMPORTANT: Unless a reactive type is returned from the publishing method, the action is blocking.
